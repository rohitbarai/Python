    "## Day 2 - Modules and pip in Python!\n",
    "**Module is like a code library which can be used to borrow code written by somebody else in our python program. There are two types of modules in python:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Built in Modules - These modules are ready to import and use and ships with the python interpreter. there is no need to install such modules explicitly**\n",
    "\n",
    "**External Modules - These modules are imported from a third party file or can be installed using a package manager like pip or conda. Since this code is written by someone else, we can install different versions of a same module with time.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The pip command\n",
    "**It can be used as a package manager pip to install a python module. Lets install a module called pandas using the following command**\n",
    "\n",
    "**pip install pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using a module in Python (Usage)\n",
    "**We use the import syntax to import a module in Python. Here is an example code:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**import pandas**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Read and work with a file named 'words.csv'**\n",
    "\n",
    "**df = pandas.read_csv('words.csv')**\n",
    "\n",
    "**print(df) # This will display first few rows from the words.csv file**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Similarly we can install other modules and look into their documentations for usage instructions.We will find ourselved doing this often in the later part of this course**"
