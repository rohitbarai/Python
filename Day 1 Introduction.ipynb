    "**Programming is a way for us to tell computers what to do. Computer is a very dumb machine and it only does what we tell it to do. Hence we learn programming and tell computers to do what we are very slow at - computation. If I ask you to calculate 5+6, you will immediately say 11. How about 23453453 X 56456?**"
